	<h2>Interactive Cookerybook</h2>
	<h3>A social cookerybook that reduces food waste.</h3>
<br/>
<p>
In order to reduce food waste I designed a concept and a prototype of an interactive cook book with three fellow students for a school project. To goal for this project was to develop an interactive design under the main topic of care, where we focused on food waste and came up with the concept of a cook book we call 'Social Foodies'.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Social Foodies focuses on the social elements of getting friends to meet and prepare dinner together based on the ingredients they already have at home – the concept aims to reduce food waste by making leftovers a social matter. The interactive cook book supplies the user with recipes based on one’s leftovers. Through the cook book, the user can invite friends for dinner and each member of the dinner party can then drag and drop any surplus food they feel like contributing to the dinner. Based on the selection of surplus foods, Social Foodies presents a list of recipes. With Social Foodies the user is able to reduce food waste by using his leftovers. 
 </p> 
<br />
<p>
In the process we moved from understanding the chosen field of care to develop a final concept by going through the stages of focus, design research, analysis, idea generation, scenario, prototyping, and presentation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
We made the prototype out of a notebook that we filled with hand-written text and cut-out magazine content, involving paper prototyping. We wanted the prototype to resemble a cook book the best way possible, as well as adapt our functions in a logical sequence. We drew boxes and pictures, and made buttons and sliders that would illustrate its functions. By resembling a traditional cook book, with its digital components hidden in the pages, it will become a natural artifact in the kitchen.
